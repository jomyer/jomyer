- 👋 Hi, I’m @jomyer
- 👀 I’m interested in APT geometry processing, postprocessors, CNC, CAM, engineering graphics - all sorts of manufacturing processes, actually.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: This would be ever-changing, wouldn't it...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on APT processors.  You can check out aptOS, for starters.
- 📫 How to reach me: not right now, thanks...
